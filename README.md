# ClayxelsPaintingEffect
a custom shader experiment with clayxels. Requires Clayxels 

This project contains a scene that use Clayxels, and a custom shader made with Amplify Shader Editor. This is by no mean a realtime friendly solution, this was a fun artistic experiment, but if you want to play with it !
